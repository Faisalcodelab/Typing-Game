Typing Speed Test Game
This project is a Typing Speed Test game that helps users improve their typing speed and accuracy. It presents a random sentence for the user to type,
measures the time taken to type the sentence, calculates words per minute (WPM), and displays typing accuracy. The game also provides feedback.

Features
Random Sentences: Displays a new random sentence for each round.
WPM (Words Per Minute): Calculates and shows the user's typing speed.
Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correctly typed characters.
Timer: Tracks the time taken to type the sentence.
Real-Time Feedback: Displays a "Try Again" message if a mistake is made during typing.

Tech Stack
HTML: Provides the structure and content of the game.
CSS: Styles the game interface.
JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including sentence generation, timer, and user input handling.
Installation
To get started, you need to clone the repository and open the project files in your local environment.

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/typing-game.git

Navigate to the project folder:

cd typing-game
Open the index.html file in your browser to start playing the game.

How It Works
When you load the game, a random sentence is displayed for you to type.
Start typing in the input box. The timer will start once you type the first character.
Your typing speed (WPM) and accuracy will be updated in real time.
If you make a mistake, the game will display a "Try Again" message, and you won't be able to continue typing until the mistake is fixed.
Once you finish typing the entire sentence correctly, the game will stop the timer, disable further input, and display your WPM and accuracy.
